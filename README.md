# First Solution in JavaScript using node.js, express.js and mongoose
<p>Once compleated I will attempt to do the same in Ruby.</p>

# You will need a .env file to run locally
1. PORT=3000 (or whichever you choose)
2. MONGO_URI= "your connection string"

# Seed Your DB
<p>You can simply run node bin/seeds.js in terminal to seed your database, it is set up to load 100 "apps", this can be changed by increasing the size of the number inside seedApps in the seeds file. 

eg: seedApps(100);
